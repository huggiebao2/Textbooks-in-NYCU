## About this book

This greatly expanded third edition of Survival Analysis- A Self-learning Text provides a highly readable description of state-of-the-art methods of analysis of survival/event-history data. This text is suitable for researchers and statisticians working in the medical and other life sciences as well as statisticians in academia who teach introductory and second-level courses on survival analysis.

The third edition continues to use the unique "lecture-book" format of the first two editions with one new chapter, additional sections and clarifications to several chapters, and a revised computer appendix. The Computer Appendix, with step-by-step instructions for using the computer packages STATA, SAS, and SPSS, is expanded this third edition to include the software package R.
